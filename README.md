Hermes (Electro-Magnetically Rapidly Exploring Trees)

Introduction:

The goal of this path planning method is to provide an optimal path and fast execution time. Since will
not be considering an omni-directional robot, the possible movement of the vehicle needs to be
included in the expansion of the tree. To constraint the path planning, we will be trying to go in-
between sets of red markers on the left side of the vehicle and green markers on the right side. The
video below shows the working scenario and an example of the desired behavior.

Solution:

To achieve the predetermined goal with the path planning constraints, it was necessary to
combine concepts from both A* and RRT*. Both have drawbacks and positives but if we incorporate the
best of both the drawbacks become insignificant. The main drawback from A* is that is works with an
already existing network/graph. RRT makes its own nodes, so it‚Äôs not bound by a discrete graph. RRT
normally takes a slightly longer time since the expansion of the tree is random so it may expand in the
opposite direction of the goal. If we use the heuristic cost function to sort the order of expanding the
trees, we can quickly select the node with the highest chance of reaching the goal with the least error.
To avoid objects, we can treat every obstacle as having the same polarity as the agent. This
diverging vector field can be used to repel the agent from the obstacles and make sure the selected path
has a good clearance. Since there is a requirement of keeping the markers on the right orientation, this
can and should be included in the cost function and expansion decision. To do so we can treat red
markers as having north polarity and green markers as south polarity. The resulting vector field along
with the divergence field can be used as a guide. Now we can simply prioritize the nodes that are more
aligned with the combine EM field and are also closer to the path goal. After the node with the least
heuristic cost has been found we can spawn N number of Nodes from it in a specific cone. This cone
parametrizes the possible movement of the vehicle with L length and ùúÉ angle of possible turn. By
incorporating the movement in the path planning we can arrive to a path that needs no post
processing/smoothing to follow.

Conclusion:
This work is a showcase of how making compromises between different methods can give optimal
results by removing each other‚Äôs drawbacks and concentrating on their pros. This path planning
algorithm is as direct as it gets because it‚Äôs based on the principle of least resistance path to imitate the
natural movement of electrons in a magnetic field.
